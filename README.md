# Welcome!

### For the parents
> CoderDojo is a joint effort between [ Expedia Inc. ] (http://www.expediainc.com/about/mission-vision-values/), [ CoderDojo ] (https://coderdojo.com/about/), and UW Tacoma's Programming club [ HusCII ] (https://dawgden.tacoma.uw.edu/organization/HuSCII). With the help from Expedia employees and UW Tacoma Students, we are striving to build a perminent space for young programmers to gather, learn from eachother, and build programming skills.

### For the kids
> Hi! Programming is crazy fun and wonderfully challenging. I wrote my first program at 12 years old on a dos computer in a language called qBasic. Much has changed since then, and now more than ever you'll find innovative resources and enthusiatic community around programming. Everything we interact with these days has a little programming hidden inside, and for me it is a great logic, creative outlet. If you're already doing programming activities on the web at home, consider dojo a place to meet and get to know other programmers like you.
